## Built with
- CSS custom properties

## What I learned
- the **opacity** property
- the position of eye icon was a little tricky for me, just had one problem will notice that the cursor is not pointer when you hover over the eye<br>

however, the pointer appears when you hover over the image itself <br>

- practice writhing this readme using [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- i was using type selectors too much, i realized that it's harder to restructure my html document without changing the css file
- I also used IDs a lot, it was not ideal but anyways I kind of got the job done
## update jan 29 2022
- I refactored the whole code
- I used grids to stack the icon-view on top of the image-equilibrium instead of the using posistioning
- `the cursor is not pointer when you hover over the eye` I fixed this issue
